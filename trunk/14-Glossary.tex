A very important term & The much longer explanations breaking over several lines here and more text to see the line breaking again and again and again and again.\\

Unsupervised Learning & 'Learning without labels' \newline
Usual goals:\newline
\begin{enumerate}
\item Compact representation of data sets (e.g. via clustering / quantization)
\item Dimension reduction (e.g.; very useful for visualization)
\item Anomaly detection of ''unusual'' data points
\end{enumerate} \\

Clustering & \\

Dimension reduction & \\

Anomaly detection & \\

Feature & \\

Model selection & \\

Model validation & \\
Nominal or categorical scale & Qualitative, but without quantitative measurements,
e.g. binary scale \(\mathbb{X} = \{0, 1\}\) (presence or absence of
properties). Ordering does not matter.\\
Ordinal scale & Measurement values are meaningful only with respect to other measurements, i.e., the rank order of measurements carries
the information, not the numerical differences {\color{orange}(\emph{e.g. information on the ranking of different marathon races)}}\\
Interval scale &  The relation of numerical differences carries
the information. Invariance w.r.t. translation and scaling {\color{orange}\emph{(Fahrenheit scale of temperature)}}.\\
Ratio scale & Zero value of the scale carries information but not the measurement unit. {\color{orange}\emph{(Kelvin scale)}}.\\
Absolute scale & Absolute values are meaningful. {\color{orange}\emph{(grades of final exams)}}\\
Data Whitening & Normalize the values of a feature vector by the standard deviation (or another scale quantity) in this component. Thereby, differences in dynamic range (e.g., by different measurement units) are eliminated.\\
