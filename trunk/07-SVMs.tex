\subsection{Introduction to Support Vector Machines}

Support vector machines (SVMs, also support vector networks[1]) are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data and recognize patterns, used for classification and regression analysis. Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples into one category or the other, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier. An SVM model is a representation of the examples as points in space, mapped so that the examples of the separate categories are divided by a clear gap that is as wide as possible. New examples are then mapped into that same space and predicted to belong to a category based on which side of the gap they fall on. (Source: Wikipedia.org)\\\\

\textbf{Idea:}linear classifier with margin and feature transformation.\\
\textbf{Transformation} from original feature space to nonlinear feature space.
\(y_i = \phi(x_i )\) e.g. Polynomial, Radial Basis Function, etc. with \(\phi : R^d \rightarrow R^e\text{ with }d << e\)

\[z_i =
\begin{cases}
+1 & \mbox{if } x_i \text{ in class } 1\\
-1 & \mbox{if } x_i \text{ in class } 2\\
\end{cases}
\]

Training vectors should be linearly separable after mapping!
Linear discriminant function:
\[g(y) = w^T y + w_0\]
\textbf{Goal:} Find hyperplane that maximizes the margin m with
\[z_i g(y_i ) = z_i (w_T y + w_0 ) \geq m~\text{ for all }y_i \in \mc{Y}\]
where vectors \(y_i\) with \(z_i g(y i ) = m\) are the support vectors.
\subsubsection{Maximal Margin Classifier}
\textbf{Invariance:} assume that the weight vector w is normalized
\( ||w|| = 1\) since a rescaling\\ \((w, w_0 ) := (\lambda w, \lambda w_0 ), m := \lambda m\) does not change the problem's solution.\\
\textbf{Condition }(\(\forall i\)):
\[z_i =
\begin{cases}
+1 & \mbox{if } x_i \text{ in class } 1 \rightarrow x^Ty_i + w_0 \geq m\\
-1 & \mbox{if } x_i \text{ in class } 2 \rightarrow x^Ty_i + w_0 \leq -m\\
\end{cases}
\]

\textbf{Objective:} Maximize margin m s.t. joint condition \(z_i (w^T y_i + w_0 ) \geq m\) is met.\\

\textbf{Learning problem:} Find w with \(||w|| = 1\), such that the margin m
is maximized.\\
Maximize m\\
subject to \(\forall y_i \in Y : z_i (w^T y_i + w_0 ) \geq m\)
